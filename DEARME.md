# Dear you

You know you are often an idiot. Read this, don't feel bad, rather be better. Understand it if you can. Come back to it as much as you need. But above all, follow these rules. They are rooting for you. Things will be better if you just follow them. Eventually the betters will add up and things will even be okay!

**FOR THE LOVE OF BEING OKAY!!**

1. Leave holidays lib and especially pyside for last. Get your functionality first

2. Do pseudocode like a mother fucker. Pen and paper first if you must.

3. Be boring this one. Just sit and type. Don't explore new concepts. Accept, succumb, be a lame little shit. It's all for future okayness, after all


# PSEUDO
## The holiday-day math
Use sets. check methods hopefully got subtraction stuff
1. Get test vacation range date range. Call it vacation_dates.
(Where did two go? Okay remember, if app fails, it's because of a missing 2)
<!-- done: got meself a list[datetime] -->
<!-- IDIOT, should be a set. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS -->
3. All holiday days for the year/area of proposed vacation. Call it holiday_dates.
(Yes, you may use the library and explore it's features all ADD pointlessly doing so much nothing. For 2hours max man.  )
4. Get all weekends in date range.
5. Get all public holidays in date range
6. Subtract the set of these two, or rather, no that is correct. Get actual leave days used
